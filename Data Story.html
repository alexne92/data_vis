					<p> After an amazing year in the NBA, where all the fans were delighted to see an astonishing spectacle, one team managed to win the trophy, and that was no other than the Golden State Warriors.
					</p>
					<p>
					As for the new season, Warriors’ duty is to prove for one more year that they are the best, LeBron James wants to take his revenge, the goal for Rockets and Celtics is to break the monopoly of the last years that the Warriors and Cavs have built, Spurs have the experience and the wisdom to reach the top while dealing with aging and Raptors have realized that the time has come to make the step further.</p>

					One major factor that had influence on the teams was the increase of the salary cap. 
					After 5 years of stability (2008-2009 to 2013-2014), the salary cap showed a huge increase of 69% to this season.
					It was something that both players and teams wanted, which changed the way that league is operating.
					</p>
					<p>
					On the one hand, the players were happy to see that their salaries are getting bigger and bigger, while the owners of the teams were capable to attract superstars in order to build dynasties.
					<br>Everybody was pleased to see Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving going the Celtics, Carmelo Anthony and Paul George joining the Thunders and Chris Paul leaving the Clippers to help James Harden getting the “ring”.

				 <div id="money-text-two">
				 <p>
				 In the next figure, where boxplots of salaries of the teams (sorted by the sum of the total salaries) can be seen, is obvious that Warriors are also the champions of spending money, because they want to retain the players that led them to the top, followed by Cavaliers. 
				Cavs have given the keys to LeBron James and this can be seen by the big difference between his and the next player’s (or even the team’s average) salary. 
				<br>More specific, LeBron has a contract for $33.285.709, while Kevin Love has about half of Lebron’s salary ($22.642.350), with the average salary for the team being $9.138.8856!
				<br>In general, someone can say that every team manages to have players with small to medium payments along with two to three superstars who are making the difference for the franchise.
				<br>One typical example is the Celtics, where Hayward’s ($29.727.900), Horford’s ($27.734.405) and Irving’s ($18.868.625) salaries being complete outliers to Boston Celtic’s salaries distribution. 
				In fact, they are the only team that their average salary is not included inside the boxplot.

					Furthermore, the graph shows the relationship between the salaries of teams and their position in the league. 
					Golden State Warriors seem to have made a good investment ($137494845 – 1st place), Cavaliers and Thunders are not performing as good as they expected ($137082833 – 6th place, $134294056 – 9th place respectively), while Celtics proved to be a “value for money” team ($109926833 – 3rd place).
					</p>
					<p>Teams in the last position (e.g. Dallas Mavericks: $86616514 – 29th place) seem to be more careful about their expenses, as they are counting on a further increase of the salary cap, in order to make the best moves possible.

				 <h2> Injuries are not a problem </h2>

				 <div id="injuries-text">
				<p>
				Injuries are one of the biggest factors for the performance of the teams. 
				Usually, the more injuries a team has, the more difficult is for the players to create automations between each other.
					Though, the team with the most injuries (28) is the first team in the league. 
					This is an interesting fact, because it shows that Warriors have a good depth in their bench and every player can contribute in any given time.
					In the next place are Celtics and Rockets (21), which are also high ranked teams in the league.
					And at this point, it is worth mentioning that Rockets and Celtics lost their big (and new) superstars Chris Paul and Gordon Hayward due to a sore on his left knee and a dislocation to his left ankle for each player.
					Adding the fact that they had so many injuries and they are in the 2nd and 3rd place respectively, means that all the players communicate and cooperate in harmony and can fill the big gap of those two players.
					On the other hand, another observation, which is worth mentioning, is the low number of injuries in Lakers team (7).
					This means that the team is healthy in most of the games, though the chemistry (or even the quality) of the team shouldn’t be that good.

				<div id="stats-text">
				<p>
				Even though basketball (and any kind of sport) is depended on the players’ condition and passion, the statistics are the best indicators for showing who is the best over time.
				And the categories, which weight more when it comes to the comparison of the teams, are mentioned in the graph above.
				Let’s have a look for the first 6 teams of the league.
				</p>
				<p>
				It comes as not surprise the fact that Golden State Warriors dominate in most categories.
				Specifically, Warriors are the best in shooting (field goals (50,7%), 2-points (57,2%), 3-points (38,5%) and free throw shots percentage (81%)), assists (1058) and blocks (300).
				In fact, they are the best in assists, blocks as well as in field goal and 2-points percentage in the NBA.
				A negative attribute for Warriors is the fact that they make more turnovers (567) than the other 5 teams.
				Rockets prefer more the offense than the defense.
				And this can be testified by the fact that their shoot accuracy is really good (especially at 2-points (56,7%) and free throw shots percentages (79,8%)).
				Moreover, something interesting about the Rockets is the low assists (733) the team has.
				And the reason is the fact that the team is totally depended on their leader, James Harden.
				Celtics’ performance is incredible, as they are the best at defensive rebounds and total rebounds (1367 and 1711 – best in the NBA) while being second, comparing to the other 5, in assists (862) and offensive rebounds (344), two categories which indicate that there is a lot of collaboration and passion in this team.
				As for Toronto Raptors, they seem to be more serious than ever.
				Among the first 6 teams, they have the least turnovers (464) than the others, which means that they are more concentrated than ever and they want this year to reach the top.
				The big advantage for Spurs is that they acknowledge the fact that offense is a good spectacle for the audience, but defense is the key factor for winning the championship.  
				That’s why their work is noticeable, as they are close the top of most defensive categories (rebounds (364 offensive, 1237 defensive rebounds) and blocks (202)).
				</p>
				<p>
				Finally, Cavaliers’ statistics are so bad that they it makes someone wonder if they really were that good last year and reached the NBA finals, completing the season as contender.
				More specifically, among the 6 teams referred in the graph, they have the worst numbers in blocks (128), and offensive rebounds (289) while their good percentage in 3-points shots (38,4%) is, most likely, the only reason why they are close to the top teams in the league.

			<h2> Verdict </h2>
			</center>
				<p>
				As everyone expected, this season is exciting for everyone. 
					The show that the teams offer is awesome, while every team wants to be the next champion.
					Golden State Warriors shows that they have built an empire and it is difficult for someone to get on their way.
					</p>
					<p>
					But this is only the start of year, and the other candidates for the title seem really strong.
					Both Houston Rockets and Boston Celtics are performing well even without their big superstars, Spurs know how to reach the top but the big question is whether they have the energy to reach the finals or not, Raptors have learned a lot over the last years and this year might be their moment while nobody can forget LeBron James and his desire to be the best.
